# comments start with a # currently everthing after the # is stripped allowing
# comments after a URL without it causing issues. This means any URL with a # in
# it will be truncated.

# The Downloader script will try and work out what to use to download depending
# on the URL of the file. You can force a download to use iplayer/youtube/http/
# ftp using that name in the first element, e.g.

youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSGBVzeBUbk

# For iPlayer you can give it a URL, or you can give it a program name E.G.

iplayer http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b05qpndx/have-i-got-news-for-you-series-49-episode-1
iplayer poldark episode 6

# you don't need the first element to specify what to use, it's really only
# useful when downloading a program using iplayer by name, The following works
# too.
